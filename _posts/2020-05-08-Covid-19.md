## Using A Logistic Model for the Covid-19 Data in R

I collected the data of total cases between March 1 and April 20.

Here is the daily number of active cases of Covid-19 in the USA, for the dates from March 1 to April 20, 2020 (see https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/):

75, 100, 124, 158, 221, 319, 435, 541, 704, 994, 1301, 1630, 2183, 2771, 3617, 4604, 6357, 9317, 13898, 19551, 24418, 33840, 44189, 55398, 68905, 86379, 105217, 124788, 144980, 165851, 190930, 217771, 248079, 280738, 315141, 340775, 372252, 406000, 438210, 472016, 505959, 536145, 563753, 590573, 617661, 648003, 677570, 709735, 738601, 764671, 792759

Suppose these data are called (Ci)1≤i≤51. We can plot them in R:

```{r echo=TRUE}
X=1:51
C=c(75, 100, 124, 158, 221, 319, 435, 541, 704, 994, 1301, 1630, 2183, 2771, 3617, 4604, 6357, 9317, 13898, 19551, 24418, 33840, 44189, 55398, 68905, 86379, 105217, 124788, 144980, 165851, 190930, 217771, 248079, 280738, 315141, 340775, 372252, 406000, 438210, 472016, 505959, 536145, 563753, 590573, 617661, 648003, 677570, 709735, 738601, 764671, 792759)
plot(X,C,type="l")

```

## A Logistic Model

Looking at the data above, it seems that the inflection point is around C(40)=472016. The date of the inflection point is April 9, 2020.


If the data can be modeled by a logistic curve, we have a logistic function for the data:
dC(t)/dt=rC(t)(M -C(t)), C(t0) =C0,        (1)
where r is constant, and M is the maximal value for Ci.

Solving the differential equation (1), we see that
dCC(M-C)=rdt 1M(1C+1M-C)dC =rdt 1M(1C+1M-C)dC =rdt lnC -lnM-C=Mrt+Mc,where c is some constant,
lnCM-C=Mrt +McC(t)M-C(t)=eMrt*eMc=AeMrtC(t)=AeMrt(M-C(t))
C(t)=AeMrtM1+AeMrt                                                                                                                          (2)
Using the initial condition C(t0) =C0, we get
A = COe-Mrt0M-C0
This yields the solution to (2)
C(t)=COe-Mrt0M-C0eMrtM1+COe-Mrt0M-C0eMrt=C0M(M-C0)e-Mr(t-t0)+C0,

With t0=1 and C0=75, we get 
C(t)=75M(M-75)e-Mr(t-1)+75                                                                  (3)

Note that 
C(t)M-C(t)=C0M(M-C0)e-Mr(t-t0)+C0M-C0M(M-C0)e-Mr(t-t0)+C0=C0eMr(t-t0)M-C0ln(C(t)M-C(t))=ln(C0M-C0)+Mr(t-t0)=Mrt +c',         (4)
where c'is some constant. So ln(C(t)M-C(t))is a linear function of t and if we can estimate M, then we can find an estimate for r.

To estimate M, we note that by (1),
dC(t)dt=rC(t)(M -C(t)) d2C(t)dt2=rMC'(t)-2rC(t)C'(t) = rC'(t)(M-2C(t))

Let C''(t)=0, we get C(t) =M2, since we guessed the inflection point in part (b) is around C(40) = 472016, an estimate for M would be M = 2*472016 = 944032.

We can now find a model for the data in R:



```{r echo=TRUE}
L=log(C/(944032-C))
lm(L~X)
```


## Including Plots

This suggests that Mr = 0.2232 by (4), since M = 944032, r = 0.2232/944032 = 0.00000024. Putting them into the formula (3), we get the model for the data:
C(t)=70802400/(943957*exp(-0.2232(t-1))+75).

In R, we can check how well the model above fits our data:


```{r echo=TRUE}
Model=70802400/(943957*exp(-0.2232*(X-1))+75)
plot(X,C)
lines(X,Model)
```
